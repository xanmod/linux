	  When enabling this option, the entropy sources are

	  the entropy sources are requested to provide 64 bits more
	  entropy than the size of the entropy buffer. For example,
	  if the entropy buffer is 256 bits, 320 bits of entropy
	  is requested to fill that buffer.

	  Second, the seed operation of the deterministic RNG
	  requests 128 bits more data from each entropy source than
	  the security strength of the DRNG during initialization.
	  A prerequisite for this operation is that the digest size
	  of the used hash must be at least equally large to generate
	  that buffer. If the prerequisite is not met, this
	  oversampling is not applied.

	  This strategy is intended to offset the asymptotic entropy
	  increase to reach full entropy in a buffer.

	  The strategy is consistent with the requirements in
	  NIST SP800-90C and is only enforced with fips=1.

	help
	  Select the default behavior of the interrupt entropy source
	  continuous compression operation.

	  The Linux RNG collects entropy data during each interrupt.
	  For performance reasons, a amount of entropy data defined by
	  the LRNG entropy collection pool size is concatenated into
	  an array. When that array is filled up, a hash is calculated
	  to compress the entropy. That hash is calculated in
	  interrupt context.

	  In case such hash calculation in interrupt context is deemed
	  too time-consuming, the continuous compression operation
	  can be disabled. If disabled, the collection of entropy will
	  not trigger a hash compression operation in interrupt context.
	  The compression happens only when the DRNG is reseeded which is
	  in process context. This implies that old entropy data
	  collected after the last DRNG-reseed is overwritten with newer
	  entropy data once the collection pool is full instead of
	  retaining its entropy with the compression operation.
