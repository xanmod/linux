	  of the existing /dev/random provided with drivers/char/random.c.
	  It generates entropy from different noise sources and
	  delivers significant entropy during boot.

config LRNG_OVERSAMPLE_ENTROPY_SOURCES
	bool "Oversample entropy sources"
	default n
	help
	  When enabling this option, the entropy sources are
	  over-sampled with the following approach: First, the
	  the entropy sources are requested to provide 64 bits more
	  entropy than the size of the entropy buffer. For example,
	  if the entropy buffer is 256 bits, 320 bits of entropy
	  is requested to fill that buffer.

	  Second, the seed operation of the deterministic RNG
	  requests 128 bits more data from each entropy source than
	  the security strength of the DRNG during initialization.
	  A prerequisite for this operation is that the digest size
	  of the used hash must be at least equally large to generate
	  that buffer. If the prerequisite is not met, this
	  oversampling is not applied.

	  This strategy is intended to offset the asymptotic entropy
	  increase to reach full entropy in a buffer.

	  The strategy is consistent with the requirements in
	  NIST SP800-90C  and is only enforced with fips=1.

	  If unsure, say N.

	default LRNG_CONTINUOUS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED
	help
	  Select the default behavior of the continuous compression
	  operation.

	  The Linux RNG collects entropy data during each interrupt.
	  For performance reasons, a amount of entropy data defined by
	  the LRNG entropy collection pool size is concatenated into
	  an array. When that array is filled up, a hash is calculated
	  to compress the entropy. That hash is calculated in
	  interrupt context.

	  In case such hash calculation in interrupt context is deemed
	  too time-consuming, the continuous compression operation
	  can be disabled. If disabled, the collection of entropy will
	  not trigger a hash compression operation in interrupt context.
	  The compression happens only when the DRNG is reseeded. This
	  implies that old entropy data collected after the last
	  DRNG-reseed is overwritten with newer entropy data instead
	  of retaining its entropy with the compression operation.

	help
	  Select the size of the LRNG entropy collection pool
	  storing data without performing a compression operation.
	  The larger the collection size is, the faster the
	  average interrupt handling will be. However, on the
	  other hand the time until the LRNG received full entropy
	  during boot time is longer because entropy is only awarded
	  to events once they are compressed. The collection
	  size represents the number of bytes of the per-CPU
	  memory used to batch up entropy event data.

	  The default value is good for regular operations. Choose
	  larger sizes for servers whose boot time is of less
	  interest. Runtime memory is precious, choose a smaller
	  size.

	  The collection size is unrelated to the entropy rate
	  or the amount of entropy the LRNG can process.
